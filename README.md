# PredictoR.r
# The goal of this project was to be able to predict stock prices for the next day based off of the current stock prices.  Unfortunately, I was not able to get the package to run in R, as it does not recognize the Predictor package.  I am unsure why as I made sure to download and install all of the necessary files and packages, but hopefully in the future I will be able to figure it out and finish the package.
